# Swarm
Shoot zombies, and don't get killed.
Use missiles to shoot through your blockers, and kill the yellow zombies that avoid regular bullets.
But be careful, zombies of the blue type can only be killed by regular bullets.
Collect the care packages that appear at the beginning of each level, to stock up on missiles and blockers.
